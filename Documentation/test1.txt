First user test

About
- at this point, i had the house with some furniture in the scene, steamvr's teleporter and laser
 pointer components and some lights.

Test
- the player felt like he was his normal height in the vr world
- he felt like the house was supposed to sketchy but it was noted that it wasn't quite so
- the player also felt like there should have been more broken furniture
- finally, the player was able to break immersion by teleporting so close to the wall that he could see outside

Fixes
- i decreased the overall lighting of the house to reduce the need for more furniture and to give it a scarier feel
- to prevent the player from teleporting too close to the wall, i added colliders to each room making sure that its not 
too close to any walls
