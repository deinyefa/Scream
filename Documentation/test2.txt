Final user test

About
- by this point, i had added:
	. diegetic features - to remove the need of adding too much text to the scene. for example, the touchpad on the
				left controller blinks to show the player how to teleport and the keys animate to show
				they can be interacted with
	. sounds - background music, key collected music and monster sounds
	. animation - of keys and monsters 
	. minimal light - the only lights available now are from the headset and the ones that illuminate the keys around 
			the house
	. a start screen

Test
- player could not see the walls even at fairly close distances (or the roof)
- the text that shows how many keys are left was too far off to the side and could easily go unnoticed
- the player could teleport too far away from his current postion and with the minimal light, it got disorienting 
really quickly

Fixes
- i changed the alpha source of the walls and roof from albedo alpha to metallic source, reducing the metallic and smoothness 
compnents to prevent the house from feels like an abandoned factory
- i also moved the text canvas from the side to the center of the headset. when the player touches a key, the text appears 
and stays for a few seconds 
- i had to change the way i implemented teleportation because i couldn't reduce the laser pointer distance while using 
SteamVR_Teleporter and SteamVR_LaserPointer, so i used the VRTK_Pointer and VRTK_StraightPointerRenderer from VRTK
