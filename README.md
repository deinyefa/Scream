# About
Six months after enrolling in the VR Nanodegree at Udacity, I have come to my final project. This one was very broad in the 
sense that we (the students enrolled in this nanodegree) were given full creative control on what we create. The only rules 
were that the project had to earn a specific number of points in 3 different categories, and had to evoke some kind of 
emotion.

<b><em>My project is called Scream, and as the name suggests, it evokes fear.</em></b>
</p>

# Unique Considerations
Sream was built for the HTC Vive, so a major design consideration was setting clear boundaries within the game since players 
have control over movement. It would not do to have players traverse to a place outside the gameplay area and break immersion. 
Another design consideration for my specific game was lighting. Since fear was the emotion I went for, it made sense to make 
the scene dark, but not too dark where players cannot get their bearings.

# Scream
The success of this game was because of the continuous iterative process implemented to systematically improve gameplay. Throughout the development of Scream, I tested, found something that needed fixing, fixed it, tested again, found something that needed fixingâ€¦ and so on.
